> To develop an effective team, you will find a team contract a very helpful start. This contract will help set expectations and necessary guidelines for your project. These expectations cover preparations for and attendance of meetings, individual behaviours, and communication. The guidelines should cover roles and responsibilities for each team member to accomplish the given task, the agreed peer feedback process, and a process for dealing with issues. All these will help to foster a sense of community amongst the team members as you get to know each other.

We are supposed to take some initial decisions

> * GOALS: What are our team goals for this project? What do we want to accomplish? What skills do we want to develop or refine?
> * EXPECTATIONS: What do we expect of one another in regard to attendance at meetings, participation, frequency of communication, the quality of work, etc.?
> * POLICIES & PROCEDURES: What rules can we agree on to help us meet our goals and expectations, such as preparatory tasks, generating ideas, evaluating Outcomes?
> * ROLES: Which roles do we need in this project and how do we allocate them? Will there be a project lead? Is there a need to rotate roles?
> * CONSEQUENCES: How will we address non-performance regarding these goals, expectations, policies and procedures? How do we resolve disagreements?

I’ll start with a point not covered in the “contract”. This assignment is doable by one person alone. We do it as a group because the goal is to experience team work. So let’s work as a team. Deliver what you can, if it’s not perfect we’ll fix it as a group. And try to have fun!

* GOALS: this assignment is basically my daily job. For me it’s a chance to refine and rediscover things.
* EXPECTATIONS: you can expect my contribution during the week very early in the morning or late in the evening, and more in the weekends. I hope we can draft something in the first few weeks to have time to finalize the project with no rush.
* POLICIES: I would suggest to push what we write on GitHub and use Slack for discussions and chat (send me your profile so I can add you to the repo!). Pushing on GitHub means that we don’t risk that someone peeks at the chat and “takes inspiration”. I don’t mind to share ideas with other teams, but it would be a problem to incur into plagiarism.
* ROLES: I’m happy to do some heavy lifting. I’m fairly experienced with the development of microservices in the cloud, so I can easily suggest solutions for this assignment too.
* CONSEQUENCES: as long as we deliver a good assignment, I’m fine with doing extra work to compensate any under-performer, and I won’t even ask why. Just remember that this master is an opportunity and missing it would be your loss.

I have slack on my phone, so if you write me I’ll probably read it during the day and reply as soon as possible.
